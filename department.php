                                <p>Perhaps one of the most artistically dynamic mediums on the planet, Animation, is the very illusion of life. Whether it’s hand-drawn or done using a computer, it always has the same goal: to take a series of images and play them back to bring life to a character. A proficient Animator is an artist with many skills and a vast array of knowledge. Among the skills of an Animator are: Creativity, Imagination, Strong Understanding of Acting, Body Mechanics, Physics, Universal Appeal, a Good Technical Aptitude, Patience and Attention to Detail. The amount of knowledge, work, time and research behind every shot demonstrates why Animation is an Art that will forever challenge an Artist.</p>

                                </div>
                                <p>The concept of compositing originated with artists such as George Melies in the late 19th century, was refined by technical innovators like Petro Vlahos and via the optical printer eventually reached the digital age of visual effects in the 1980s. These early pioneers and their techniques still influence the way we work in compositing today!</p>
                                <p>At CurveMediaAds we now use digital compositing software to combine multiple source images, such as digital matte paintings, full CG environments, CG creatures and live action plates to produce a believable, photorealistic final image. Compositing is near the end of the VFX pipeline, which means an artist will be one of the last people to touch a shot before it reaches the cinema screens, but we also rely on, and enjoy a close working relationship with the departments that produce renders for us.</p>

                                <p>Crowd can be used for any number of agents, from a couple of people to several hundred thousand. Generally, Crowd get involved when it’s too much for Animation to handle – it’s quicker to use Motion Capture, or more of a simulated approach is required to create a shot. In the past we have taken on huge armies, flocks of birds, herds of mammoths, swarms of insects, zombie hordes, space battles and many other types of simulations.</p>

We also assist the environment team with the creation of organic elements, such as grasses, mosses, and trees</p>
                                <p>Groom artists work closely with other departments, including Modelling, Texturing, Lookdev and Techanim, to ensure our characters achieve a high level of photorealism. We are one the leading departments for groom work in the world, having worked on projects such as Blade Runner, Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them, and now The Lion King. Our groom work on The Life of Pi and Jungle Book were heavy influences on CurveMediaAds winning the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, and we continue to work on potential Oscar winning work every day!</p>

                                <p>The Layout Department at CurveMediaAds is a key building block in the process that defines the ‘stage’ for downstream departments. It is a multitasking team covering many roles such as previs, set-dressing and Stereo to name a few. From the start, previs/postvis can be handled from scratch or replicated from client turnover.</p>
                                <p>The second step usually involves the integration of Match-move and roto-animation into a live-action plate. Rough layouts can include character, camera and environment blocking. Once animation is under-way, collaboration with set-dressing and stereo are roles that we also play a part in.</p>
								<p>Presentation has become a vital part of the way we interface with the client and we have moved that bar forward since incorporating renderFlow into our tool-set. It is also important we manage and QC shot data flow, which we currently do using Genome. Where used effectively, Layout can greatly increase efficiencies by defining key elements and story points.</p>

								<b>Overview</b>
                                <p>The Lighting department is the linchpin of all the CG departments here at CurveMediaAds. We bring together the wonderful asset work completed in our London and Bangalore studios with the animation, tech anim, FX and 3DDMP work created locally, delivering rendered frames to our local and Bangalore composting departments for completion.</p>
								<b>Lighting and shot teams</b>
								<p>Lighting run a sequence based shot team structure which we use alongside our sequence render (SQR) work flow which enables us to execute a large volume of work through the department.</p>
                                <p>Whilst we are still in the process of rolling out shot teams through the department we are already seeing the positive impact this approach to working has on our shows and I am looking forward to seeing a really positive change in our work flows going forward.</p>
								<b>Lighting team and tool sets</b>
                                <p>We have a diverse range of talented people within the department with one common goal – to make the best rendered image possible.</p>
                                <p>We achieve this goal through the skills of the people who work here and the high end tools we use.</p>

                                <p>Many of our production team start their career as a runner and then move on to become Production Assistants, either working on a specific show or supporting an individual department.

                                <p>Sitting between the worlds of Modeling and Animation, the Rigging team work to provide solutions to make the model pose-able. There are two primary areas of focus for a rigger:</p>
                                <p>Animation Control Setup: Provide the systems by which the animation team can manipulate and pose a given character. Whether it’s an animal, space-ship or human character, the animator needs to be able to efficiently and effectively pose their work, being flexible at the same time as obeying physical constraints to help produce the very best animation.</p>
								<p>Deformation Solutions: To produce the final render mesh, a rigger might work with any number of sophisticated technologies to emulate natural skin deformations as accurately as possible – at the same time as retaining real creative control. From Muscle Simulation to Blend Shape technologies, a rigger will apply their anatomical, scientific and technical knowledge and skills to get the very best results, whether naturalistic or fantastical.</p>

								<p>Rotoscopy:</p>
								<p>Rotoscopy is a vital process within the visual effects pipeline, used to take out elements from live-action footage or add elements within it.<br>
								Roto artists will trace objects using a set of tools to create alpha channel for a specific part of an image sequence.<br>
								Depending upon the complexity of the shot, process of rotoscopy can take hours or even days to complete.</p>
								<p>Prep:</p>
								<p>Paint and Prep artists digitally prepare plates for compositing department.<br>
								A big part of visual effects work is removing or altering unwanted items in shots, which includes wires, rigs, blemishes, crew, harnesses on actors.<br>
								Artists generate clean patches through collaging or clone painting on a still/sequence of frames.<br>
								High level of quality control and a keen eye for detail work is necessary as the work must be invisible.</p>

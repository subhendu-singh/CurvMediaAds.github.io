                        <p>TV advertising means conveying a message, typically to market a product or service. TV advertising allows you to show and tell a wide audience about your business, product, or service. It allows you to actually demonstrate the benefits of ownership.

Television advertising advantages are TV reaches a much larger audience than local newspapers and radio stations, and it does so during a short period of time. It reaches viewers when they’re the most attentive. It allows you to convey your message with sight, sound, and motion, which can give your business, product, or service instant credibility. It gives you an opportunity to be creative and attach a personality to your business, which can be particularly effective for small businesses that rely on repeat customers.</p>

                        <p>Among the advantages of TV advertising is the opportunity to reach mass audiences with a single ad spot. Watching TV is the nation’s most common leisure activity, with the average American watching around five hours every day. Additionally, studies have shown that 60 percent of consumers are likely to make a purchase after viewing an advertisement on TV compared to only slightly over 40 percent for viewing ads online or over social media.</p>
						<p>In contrast, radio audiences tend to be more segmented and smaller because of the larger number of local stations compared with television. Because local TV stations are fewer, audiences are spread into larger segments of people who will see your ad. Also, the widespread appeal of TV may make consumers more receptive to TV advertising compared with other media. Many audiences are interested in and attracted to creative, well-made TV advertisements as demonstrated in the popular hype over Super Bowl commercials.</p>

                        <p>Other advantages of advertising on television are the ability to target specific audiences and expand reach by encouraging further engagement on social media. Advertisers can target their audience by purchasing ad spots during shows their intended demographic is likely to be watching. Toy manufacturers may want to advertise during Saturday morning cartoons, for example, while a local bar and grill may want to advertise during sporting events. Business owners can choose to advertise with independent or local TV stations to further narrow the demographic focus.</p>
						<p>Both reach and brand awareness can be expanded as advertisers encourage viewers to engage with their product while using additional technology and social media outlets. Over 70 percent of television viewers use an additional device such as a tablet or smartphone while watching TV and are often engaged with friends online at the same time. Advertisers can encourage engagement by instructing viewers to enter a sweepstakes online or visit their website. Viewers are also more likely to text friends about a product they just saw advertised or search for more information on a product in which they are interested.</p>

                        <p>A captive audience and no additional competition are other advantages of TV ads. Even if only for a few seconds, a TV ad puts only your product is in the spotlight. This contrasts with newspapers, telephone directories or other print media where ads may be relatively small and placed directly alongside competitor ads. In radio, listeners frequently listen to several stations by flipping through the radio dial, so advertisers might need to advertise on many stations to reach their intended audiences and consumers may encounter competitors' products.</p>

                        <p>Although TV advertisements are more costly to produce than other ads and commercial air time can be expensive, promotional material on television is the most influential because consumers trust it above other mediums. It has the advantage of sophistication ahead of any other medium because it combines both visual and auditory stimulation. Interesting camera angles, and the combination of pictures and words is not only more exciting, but gives a more realistic view of a product than a single static photograph. Television advertising has the ability to show a product, demonstrate its use and explain the benefits of ownership or consumption.</p>
